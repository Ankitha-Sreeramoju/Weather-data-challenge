# WEATHER DATA CHALLENGE

I am interested in weather trends in Tallahassee Florida.  I want you to analyze data about historical temperatures using the following data set:

1. I want to know what day of the year has the highest variance in high temperature between 1948 and 2022.

2.  Does this dataset suggest a warming trend between 1948 and 2022?  Supported answer with data.

3.  If I am planning a 30 day vacation in Tallahassee and I want the high temperature to fall between 75 and 80 the most days possible, what day should I plan to arrive?  Used the total number of days from 1948 to 2022 that fall in that range and maximize the total.

4.If  suspected that a few of the temperature readings were inaccurate,  describe how i would select the possible a candidates and identify which ones those are in the dataset.  How would I determine whether these are inaccuracies or just strange weather patterns for those days?
